This directory contains all the relevant data and analysis for producing our best estimate on the biomass of viruses.

In order to estimate the biomass of viruses, we first estimate the total number of bacteriophages and the characteristic carbon content of a bacteriophage.

For more details about the calculation of the total biomass of viruses see our [full calculation](phage_biomass_estimate.html) or see our detailed section regarding:

1. [Estimating the total number of bacteriophages](./phage_num)
2. [Estimating the characteristic carbon content of a bacteriophage](./carbon_content)
