Assuming bulk soil density of ≈1.5 g cm$^3$, and soil depth of 10 meters (based on [Shangguan et al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016MS000686)), we estimate the total number of phages per $m^2$ to be:"

    "There are no good indicators for the uncerainty of our estimate of the total number of phages in soils. The range of ~$10^8-10^9$ phages per gram of soil introduces an uncertainty of about an order of magnitude. The specific values of the bulk density of soils, as well as the depth of soils also have uncertainty associated with them, which is hard to quantify. Our estimate is likely to be an overestimate, as it likely that the concentration of phages in deeper soil layers will be lower than in shallower layers, as is for prokaryotes.\n",
