    "# Estimating the total number of terrestrial deep subsurface phages\n",
    "Estimating the total number of phages in the terrestrial deep subsurface is challenging as data on the abundance of phages in this environment is scarce. To generate an estimate for the total number of phages present in the terrestrial deep subsurface, we combined five different types of estimates for the ratio between the concentration of prokaryotes and phage-like particles. Below we detail these five different estimates. \n",

    "## Generating estimates for the total number of phages in the terrestrial deep subsurface\n",
    "These estimates of the ratio of the concentration of phage-like particles and prokaryotes can be used to estimate the total number of phages by plugging into them an estimate for the total number of prokaryotes in the terrestrial deep subsurface. After detailing the five estimates of the ratio between the number of phage-like particles and prokaryotes, we discuss the estimate of the total number of prokaryotes in the terrestrial deep subsurface that we plug into the ratios to generate estimates of the total number of phages in the terrestrial deep subsurface.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, it is not clear whether the measured ratios between the concentrations of phage-like particles and prokaryotes refer to attached or unattached cells. We take this factor into consideration in our estimate as a scaling factor that converts the estimated number of phages in groundwater to an estimate for the total number of phages. Our best estimate for this factor is a geometric mean of three estimates. The first takes into account only groundwater, and the other two assume an that attached cells (and thus also phages) are ≈$10^2-10^3$ more abundant than cell in groundwater (as estimated in [McMahon & Parnell](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1574-6941.12196)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The estimates of the ratio between the concentration of phage-like particles and prokaryotes can be divided to two categories: estimates that are invariant to the local concentration of prokaryotes and ratios that are dependent on the local concentration of prokaryotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first category of estimates includes the naive estimate and the estimates by Pan et al. and Roundnew et al. For those estimates, we can just plug in an estimate for the total number of prokaryotes in the terrestrial deep subsurface and get an estimate for the total number of phages. The second category includes the estimates by Engelhardt et al. and Kyle et al. For those estimates, we need to use the local concentrations of prokaryotes to generate local concentrations of phage-like particles, and then sum all the local concentrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with generating the estimates for the first category of estimates of the ratio between the concentration of phage-like particles and prokaryotes. The total number of prokaryotes we use is based on our analysis of the biomass of terrestrial bacteria and archaea (see relevant section in the Supplementary Information). As we note in the section on the biomass of terrestrial deep subsurface prokaryotes, we generate two estimates for the total number of cells in groundwater - one based on arithmetic means of cell concentrations at several depth bins, and the other based on geometric means of cell concentraions at the same depth bins.
