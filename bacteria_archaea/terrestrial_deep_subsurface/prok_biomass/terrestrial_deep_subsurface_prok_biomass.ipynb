    "# Estimating the total biomass of bacteria and archaea in the terrestrial deep subsurface\n",
    "This notebook details the procedure for estimating the total biomass of  of prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) in the terrestrial deep subsurface. Our estimate is based on the data on cellconcentration in the terrestrial deep subsurface collected by [McMahon & Parnell](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1574-6941.12196), as well as data on the global volume of groundwater from [Gleeson et al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ngeo2590).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Number of cells\n",
    "To estimate the total number of cells of bacteria and archaea in the terrestrial deep subsurface, we follow a similar methodology to that detailed in McMahon & Parnell. We use ≈100 measurements of cell concentration in groundwater samples from depths of 0-2000 m. We bin the samples based on their depths to 250 meter bins. For each bin we calculate both the arithmetic and geometric means. Depth bins missing from the data were extrapolated by using a regression equation that predicts the concentration of cells from the depth of the sample. This yields two estimates for the characteristic cell concentration at each depth bin."

    "Combining all the uncertainty of the factors above, we calculate an uncertainty of ≈14-fold in the biomass of bacteria and archaea in the terrestrial deep subsurface.\n",
    "As we state in the Supplementary Information, there are other sources of uncertainty that for which we are not able to provide a quantitative estimate. The procedure of binning cell concentrations with depth and fitting an equation which extrapolates cell concentrations across all depths has uncertainty associated with it, and while we did calculate some uncertainty associated with this process, it probably does not represent the entire uncertainty associated with this process. The uncertainty stemming from possible contribution from groundwater deeper than 2 km is also hard to quantify, as the cell concentration at those depths and the volume of groundwater are poorly explored. We thus chose to project an uncertainty of ≈20-fold as our best projection of the uncertainty associated with the biomass of bacteria and archaea in the terrestrial deep subsurface."
