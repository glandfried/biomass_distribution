As we do not know the 95% confidence interval of the estimate including Ocean Gyre sites, we use the 95% confidence interval from the estimate excluding Ocean Gyre sites as a measure of the intra-study uncertainty of the estimate of the total number of bacteria and archaea in the marine deep subsurface. We report uncertainty as a multiplicative factor, so we calculate the fold change of the minimal and maximal values in the 95% confidence interval relative to the mean estiamte and use this value as the intra-study uncertainty of Parkes et al."

Kallmeyer et al. bootstrap the parameters of the model for estimating the total number of cells, which results in a distribution of estimates for the total number of cells. Kallmeyer et al. report a range of one standard deviation from the mean estimate of ≈$1.2×10^{29}-≈8×10^{29}$. We use this range as a measure of the intra-study uncertainty of the estimate by Kallmeyer et al. As Kallmeyer et al. only reports a standard deviation range, we convert this range to 95% multiplicative confidence interval by calculating the fold change of the minimum and maximum of the range relative to the average estimate by Kallmeyer et al., and taking this fold change to the power of 1.96 to move from one standard deviation to 95% confidence interval."
