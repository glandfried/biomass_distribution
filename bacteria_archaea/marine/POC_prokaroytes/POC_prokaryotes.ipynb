    "# Estimateing the biomass contribution of particle-attached bacteria and archaea in the ocean\n",
    "In order to estimate the total biomass of bacteria and archaea attached to particulate organic matter (POM), we assemble studies which report the local contribution of particle-attached bacteria and archaea to the total number of cells. We focus here on the two main categories of POM - macroaggregates (>0.5 mm in diameter) and microaggregates (smaller then 0.5 mm in diameter ). We estimate the biomass contribution of bacteria and archaea attached to each size category, and then sum up the contributions to estimate the total biomass of particle-attached bacteria and archaea in the ocean. We first survey data on the fraction of the total number of cells which is attached to either macro- or microaggregates. We then estimate the carbon content of particle-attached cells relative to free-living cells.\n",

We thus generate two estimates for the fraction of particle-attached cells out of the total population of marine bacteria and archaea- one based on arithmetic means and one based on geometric means. The estimate based on the arithmetic mean is more susceptible to sampling bias, as even a single measurement which is not characteristic of the global population (such as samples which are contaminated with organic carbon sources, or samples which have some technical biases associated with them) might shift the average concentration significantly. On the other hand, the estimate based on the geometric mean might underestimate global biomass as it will reduce the effect of biologically relevant high biomass concentrations. As a compromise between these two caveats, we chose to use as our best estimate the geometric mean of the estimates from the two methodologies."
