# # Estimateing the biomass contribution of particle-attached bacteria and archaea in the ocean
# In order to estimate the total biomass of bacteria and archaea attached to particulate organic matter (POM), we assemble studies which report the local contribution of particle-attached bacteria and archaea to the total number of cells. We focus here on the two main categories of POM - macroaggregates (>0.5 mm in diameter) and microaggregates (smaller then 0.5 mm in diameter ). We estimate the biomass contribution of bacteria and archaea attached to each size category, and then sum up the contributions to estimate the total biomass of particle-attached bacteria and archaea in the ocean. We first survey data on the fraction of the total number of cells which is attached to either macro- or microaggregates. We then estimate the carbon content of particle-attached cells relative to free-living cells.
# 
# ## Fraction of number of cells which is particle-attached
# ### Macroaggregates
# In order to estimate the total biomass of bacteria and archaea attached to macroaggregates, we collected data from several studies which report the fraction of the total number of bacteria and archaea which is attached to macroaggregates. Here is a sample of the data:

# In[1]:


# Import dependencies
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import gmean
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '../../../statistics_helper')
from CI_helper import *
from fraction_helper import *
pd.options.display.float_format = '{:,.2f}'.format

# Load data
macro = pd.read_excel('poc_data.xlsx','Macroaggregates')
macro.head()


# To generate our best estimate for the fraction of cells attached to macroaggregates, we first calculate the average fraction of particle-attached cells within each study. We calculate both the arithmetic mean fraction as well as the geometric mean fraction of cells.

# In[2]:


# Calculate the mean fraction of particle-attached cells whitin each study
macro_study_mean = macro.groupby('Reference')['Fraction of cells in aggregates'].apply(np.nanmean)
macro_study_gmean = macro.groupby('Reference')['Fraction of cells in aggregates'].apply(frac_mean)


# We then calculate the mean fraction of particle-attached cells between different studies. We calculate both the arithmetic mean fraction as well as the geometric mean fraction of cells. We thus generate two estimates for the fraction of particle-attached cells out of the total population of marine bacteria and archaea- one based on arithmetic means and one based on geometric means. The estimate based on the arithmetic mean is more susceptible to sampling bias, as even a single measurement which is not characteristic of the global population (such as samples which are contaminated with organic carbon sources, or samples which have some technical biases associated with them) might shift the average concentration significantly. On the other hand, the estimate based on the geometric mean might underestimate global biomass as it will reduce the effect of biologically relevant high biomass concentrations. As a compromise between these two caveats, we chose to use as our best estimate the geometric mean of the estimates from the two methodologies.

# In[3]:


# Calculate the mean fraction of particle-attached cells between different studies
macro_mean = np.nanmean(macro_study_mean)
macro_gmean = frac_mean(macro_study_gmean)

# Use the geometric mean of the arithmetic and geometric mean based estimates as our best estimate
best_macro_frac = frac_mean(np.array([macro_mean,macro_gmean]))

print('Our best estimate for the fraction of the toal number of marine bacteria and archaea which is attached to macroaggregates is ≈%.0f percent' %(best_macro_frac*100))


# ### Microaggregates
# In order to estimate the total biomass of bacteria and archaea attached to microaggregates, we collected data from several studies which report the fraction of the total number of bacteria and archaea which  is attached to macroaggregates. Here is a sample of the data:

# In[4]:


# Load the data on microaggregates
micro = pd.read_excel('poc_data.xlsx','Microaggregates')
micro.head()


# In a similar manner to our procedure regarding macroaggregates, we calculate the arithmetic and geometric means of the fraction of particle-attached cells within each study:

# In[5]:


# Calculate the mean fraction of particle-attached cells whitin each study
micro_study_mean = micro.groupby('Reference')['Fraction of attached cells'].apply(np.nanmean)
micro_study_gmean = micro.groupby('Reference')['Fraction of attached cells'].apply(frac_mean)


# We then calculate the mean fraction of particle-attached cells between different studies. We calculate both the arithmetic mean fraction as well as the geometric mean fraction of cells. We thus generate two estimates for the fraction of particle-attached cells out of the total population of marine bacteria and archaea- one based on arithmetic means and one based on geometric means. We use as our best estimate the geometric mean of the estimates from the two methodologies.

# In[6]:


# Calculate the mean fraction of particle-attached cells between different studies
micro_mean = micro_study_mean.mean()
micro_gmean = frac_mean(micro_study_gmean)

# Use the geometric mean of the arithmetic and geometric mean based estimates as our best estimate
best_micro_frac = frac_mean(np.array([micro_mean,micro_gmean]))

print('Our best estimate for the fraction of the toal number of marine bacteria and archaea which is attached to microaggregates is ≈%.0f percent' %(best_micro_frac*100))


# ## Carbon content of particle-attached cells
# Several studies have indicated that particle-attached cells are more bigger in volume, and thus more carbon rich. To estimate the carbon content of particle-attached cells we use two strategies. The first is based on studies  which report the carbon content of particle-attached cells relative to free-living cells. We assume the carbon content of bacteria and archaea which are attached to microaggregates and macroaggregates is similar. 
# 
# ### Relative carbon content
# We first calculate the geometric mean of the size of particle-attached cells relative to free-living cells within each study. Then we calculate the geometric mean of the values reported by different studies as our best estimate for the size of particle-attached cells relative to free-living cells.

# In[7]:


# Calculate the geometric mean of the relative size of particle attached cells within each study
rel_size_study = macro.groupby(['Location','Reference'])['Size of cells relative to free-living cells'].apply(gmean)

# Calculate the geometric mean of the values reported in different studies as our best estimate
best_rel_size = gmean(rel_size_study.dropna())

print('Our best estimate for the size of particle-attached cells relative to free-living cells is ≈%1.f-fold' % best_rel_size)


# ### Volume of particle-attached cells
# We assembled studies estimating the volume of particle-attached cells. We convert this volume to carbon content using the allometric relation reported by [Simon & Azam](http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps051201). The allometric model is:
# $$C = 88.1 \times V^{0.59}$$
# We first calculate the geometric mean of volumes within each study:

# In[8]:


# Calculate the geometric mean of the volume of particle-attached cells reported within each study
vol_study = macro.groupby('Reference')['Volume of cells [µm^3]'].apply(gmean)


# We then calculate the geometric mean of volumes reported in different studies. We convert our best estimate to the volume of particle-attached cells to carbon content based on the formula reported in Simon & Azam. We calculate the carbon content of particle-attached cells relative to free-living cells based on our estimate for the carbon content of free-living bacteria and archaea in the ocean of ≈11 fg C (see the relevant section in the Supplementary Information for more details).

# In[9]:


# Calculate the geometric mean of volumes reported in different studies
best_vol = gmean(vol_study.dropna())

# The allometric model reported by Simon & Azam
sa_model = lambda x: 88.1*x**0.59

# Convert our best estimate for the volume of particle-attached cells to carbon content
best_cc = sa_model(best_vol)

# Our best estimate for the carbon content of free-living marine bacteria and archaea 
free_living_cc = 11

# Calculate the relative carbon content of particle-attached cells.
vol_rel_size = best_cc/free_living_cc

print('Our best estimate for the carbon content of particle-attached cells relative to free-living cells based on volume is ≈%1.f-fold' % vol_rel_size)


# We use the geometric mean of the two estimates of the carbon content of particle-attached cells relative to free-living cells as our best estimate:

# In[10]:


best_rel_cc= gmean([best_rel_size,vol_rel_size])
print('Our best estimate for the carbon content of particle-attached cells relative to free-living cells is ≈%1.f-fold' % best_rel_cc)


# To estimate the fraction of the total biomass of marine bacteria and archaea which is particle-attached, we sum up the fraction of the total number of cells contributed by cells attached to micro- and macroaggregates, and multiply it by the relative carbon content of particle-attached cells:

# In[11]:


best_estimate = (best_macro_frac+best_micro_frac)*best_rel_cc

print('Our best estimate for the fraction of the total biomass of marine bacteria and archaea which is particle-attached is ≈%.0f percent' %(best_estimate*100))


# # Uncertainty analysis
# To project the uncertainty associated with our estimate of the fraction of the total biomass of marine bacteria and archaea which is particle-attached, we first project the uncertainty associated with the two factors of our estimate - the fraction of the total number of cells which is particle-attached and the relative carbon content of particle-attached cells
# 
# ## Fraction of cells
# We first assess the uncertainty associated with the estimate of the fraction of the total number of cells which is attached to microaggregates and macroaggregates.
