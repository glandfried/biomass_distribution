# # Quantifying the probability of the marine trophic pyramids being inverted
# In order to quantify the probability of consumer biomass in the marine environment being lrager than producer biomass, we randomly sample from the distribution of our estimates for the biomass of each taxon of producer of consumer biomass. For each taxon with no uncertainty estimate, we assume its uncertainty is an order of magnitude.
