    "# Estimating the biomass of marine protists\n",
    "Our estimate of the total biomass of marine protists relies on estimates of global biomass for many plankton groups. We included estimates of all plankton groups that are dominated by protists. The main groups with a significant biomass contribution were picoeukaryotes, microzooplankton (defined not to include copepod biomass), diatoms, *Phaeocystis* and Rhizaria. The estimates for all plankton groups except Rhizaria are based on [Buitenhuis et al.](http://search.proquest.com/openview/0e8e5672fa28111df473268e13f2f757/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=105729), which used data from the MAREDAT database. The protist group Rhizaria is under represented in the MAREDAT database, and thus our estimate for the total biomass of Rhizaria is based on *in situ* imaging work by [Biard et al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature17652).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the etimates based on MAREDAT data, Buitenhuis et al. estimates the total biomass of a specific plankton group by using a characteristic biomass concentration for each depth (either a median or average of the values in the database) and applying across the entire volume of ocean at that depth. Buitenhuis et al. generates two types of estimates are supplied for the global biomass of each plankton group: a “minimum” estimate which uses the median concentration of biomass from the database, and a “maximum” estimate which uses the average biomass concentration. Because the distributions of values in the database are usually highly skewed by asymmetrically high values the median and mean are loosely associated by the authors of the MAREDAT study with a minimum and maximum estimate. The estimate based on the average value is more susceptible to biases in oversampling singular locations such as blooms of plankton species, or of coastal areas in which biomass concentrations are especially high, which might lead to an overestimate. On the other hand, the estimate based on the median biomass concentration might underestimate global biomass as it will reduce the effect of biologically relevant high biomass concentrations. Therefore, here and in all estimates based on MAREDAT data, we take the geometric mean of the “minimum” and “maximum” estimates (actually median and mean values of the distribution) as our best estimate, which will increase our robustness to the effects discussed above. \n",
