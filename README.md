# The Biomass Distribution on Earth
This repository contains all source data and code for the analysis found in "The Distribution of Biomass on Earth" by Yinon Bar-On, Rob Phillips and Ron Milo.

An index for the structure of this repository is given below:

* **[`plants/`](./plants)|** Data and code for estimating the total biomass of plants

* **[`bacteria_archaea/`](./bacteria_archaea)|** Data and code for estimating the total biomass of bacteria & arechaea

* **[`fungi/`](./fungi)|** Data and code for estimating the total biomass of fungi

* **[`protists/`](./protists)|** Data and code for estimating the total biomass of fungi

* **[`animals/`](./animals)|** Data and code for estimating the total biomass of animals

* **[`viruses/`](./viruses)|** Data and code for estimating the total biomass of viruses

* **[`MAREDAT_consistency_check/`](./MAREDAT_consistency_check)|** Consistency checks for estimates based on the MARine Ecosystem DATa (MEREDAT)

* **[`statistics_helper/`](./statistics_helper)|** Helper functions for generating our best estimates as well as uncertainty projections

Each directory contain Jupyter notebooks detailing the analysis leading to our estimates. To make our analysis accessible, we provide the notebooks in three file formats: `.ipynb` files, `.html` files and `.py` files.
