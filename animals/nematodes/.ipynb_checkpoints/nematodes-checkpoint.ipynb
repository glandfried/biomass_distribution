We generate two estimates for the total biomass of annelids, one based on average biomass densities and one based on median biomass densities. The estimate based on the average biomass density is more susceptible to sampling bias, as even a single measurement which is not characteristic of the global population (such as samples which are in non-natural conditions, or samples which have some technical biases associated with them) might shift the average biomass density significantly. On the other hand, the estimate based on median biomass densities might underestimate global biomass as it will reduce the effect of biologically relevant high biomass concentrations. As a compromise between these two caveats, we chose to use as our best estimate the geometric mean of the estimates from the two methodologies.\n",
