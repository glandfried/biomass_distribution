    "# Estimating the biomass of Cnidarians\n",

    "Our estimate of the total biomass of plaktonic cnidarians is based on [Lucas et al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.12169), which assembled a large dataset of abundance mauresments of different dypes of gelatinous zooplankton. Globally, they estimate ≈0.04 Gt C of gelatinous zooplankton, of which 92% are contributed by cnidarians. Therefore, we estimate the total biomass of planktonic cnidarians at ≈0.04 Gt C.\n"
